# ü•ï Miabread/dotfiles üêá

The monorepo of my various config files for my various computers. Mainly managed by nixos and home-manager.

## Overview

If you're looking for something specific, this section might help.

### Configs of Note

- [Neovim](/home-manager/nvim)
- [Hyprland](/hosts/lilac/home-manager/desktop/hyprland.nix)
- [Vscode (old)](/hosts/lilac/home-manager/dev/vscode.nix)

### Structure

| Folder                            | Purpose                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [`/hosts/`](/hosts)               | Individual machine configurations              |
| [`/nixos/`](/nixos)               | OS configuration files                         |
| [`/home-manager/`](/home-manager) | All home dotfiles, most things will be in here |
| [`/secrets/`](/secrets)           | Secrets managed by sops-nix                    |

Note [`lilac` has some modules](/hosts/lilac) that haven't been refactored into the new structure yet. This is on the TODO list.

## Laptop "lilac" Hyprland Keybindings

Section dedicated to the readme file pre-multi-machine refactor. You can find the  code for reference in the [Hyprland](/hosts/lilac/home-manager/desktop/hyprland.nix) config.

### Workspaces (ASDXC)

Layout that allows managing workspaces with minimal left hand reach.

Each workspace is dedicated to an application I use often.

| --- | --------- |
| A   | Browser   |
| S   | Editor    |
| D   | Notes     |
